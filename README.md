This project is designed to provide users with an interactive platform where they can draw on a canvas, change colors from a palette, and submit their drawings for processing. The backend processes the drawn images and returns calculated results based on predefined logic. It integrates both frontend and backend technologies, including React for the user interface and FastAPI for the backend server, allowing for seamless communication between the client and server. This setup provides a user-friendly experience while ensuring efficient data handling and processing.
